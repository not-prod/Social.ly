## ⚙️ Tech Stack

### Frontend

• React (Create React App)\
• React Router DOM\

## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your system.

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/\<your-username\>/\<your-repo-name\>.git\
cd \<your-repo-name\>

### 2️⃣ Setup Backend

cd backend\
npm install\
\
Start the backend server:\
\
npm run dev\
\
By default, backend runs on http://localhost:5000\
\
Example .env file:\
PORT=5000\
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url\
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key

### 3️⃣ Setup Frontend

cd ../frontend\
npm install\
\
Start the frontend:\
\
npm start\
\
By default, frontend runs on http://localhost:3000

## 🔗 Connecting Frontend and Backend

Ensure your frontend API calls point to the backend server URL, e.g.:\
\
axios.get(\"http://localhost:5000/api/users\");

## 🧩 Build Scripts

Backend:\
{\
\"dev\": \"nodemon server.js\"\
}\
\
Frontend:\
{\
\"start\": \"react-scripts start\",\
\"build\": \"react-scripts build\"\
}

## 🧠 Folder Responsibilities

backend/: Contains Express server, routes, controllers, and
configurations.\
frontend/: Contains React app, components, and pages.

## 🚀 Deployment

1\. Build the frontend: npm run build\
2. Serve the built frontend from backend or deploy separately on
Vercel/Netlify.\
3. Deploy backend using Render, Railway, AWS, or Heroku.
